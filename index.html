                <p class="text-muted text-left">One of the most exciting events for Challenger students each year is the Science Fair. In the months preceding the contest, students come up with their project hypotheses and conduct experiments using the scientific method to test their assertions.Students in kindergarten through grade 2 work in groups to research, document, and present their findings. Beginning in third grade, students complete individual projects, and from fifth grade forward, the projects are assessed by judging panels. At the campus Science Fair, parents and teachers can peruse exhibits and discuss with students their ingenious and thought-provoking experiments and inventions. Challenger has developed a tradition of excellence in science. Each year, many Challenger students earn regional awards and advance to state finals and beyond. Quite a few Challenger students over the years have achieved prestigious honors in nationwide science competitions, too!</p>

Through participating in the Speech Festival, Challenger students from kindergarten through grade 8 gain confidence in their ability to speak in public, a skill that will serve them well in life. Kindergarten students choose poetry selections learned in class, and students in grades 1–4 recite poems of their choice. Fifth graders choose speeches or speech excerpts from literature or history. Middle schoolers write and present their original speeches. The Challenger Speech Festival highlights our shining stars at their best and displays their mastery of composition, literature, public speaking, logic, current events, and history. More than any other contest, it showcases the poise, confidence, and mature values of our students.</p>

                <p>After reading her award-winning essay in front of 3,000 people early this summer in Washington, D.C., Ishana Wokhlu said she has “grown more confident.”

“I am still in shock. I feel very honored to have received such a prestigious award from this wonderful organization,” Ishana said. “I was a little nervous to read my essay in front of such a large group of people, but everyone there was so kind and supportive.”

The rising sixth-grader at Challenger School in Sunnyvale wrote about the 19th Amendment, evaluating the different perspectives of women’s suffrage from the point of view of someone in 1919.

“I enjoy understanding the consequences of the choices different societies made, especially those related to natural rights and freedom,” Ishana said. “It’s important to know how people behaved in the past, because their decisions affect our lives today. We can learn from their actions to make better choices in the future.”

Ishana wrote the piece for class and then submitted it to the American History Essay Contest organized by the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution, which supports education, preserves local landmarks and historical structures, promotes citizenship and patriotism, and supports veterans’ activities. The Los Altos Chapter of NSDAR sponsored her.

After winning the local, state and division levels, Ishana won the national level against eight other divisional winners from throughout the United States. She received a cash prize, a certificate and a gold pin June 27 in Washington, D.C.

“We are delighted for Ishana and feel our nation is in good hands with this smart and lovely young woman,” said Donna Santistevan, regent of the NSDAR’s Los Altos chapter.</p>

As we open for school, we do so carefully and safely, as outlined in our COVID-19 Practices: CA (Alameda County or Santa Clara County), ID, NV, TX, UT. We recommend on-campus learning as the best educational choice for children, as we’ve witnessed the amazing results firsthand. For those students who cannot attend for a period of time or choose not to participate in on-campus learning, our online learning program will be available and run parallel to our on-campus program for preschool–eighth grade students. Capacities are limited in our programs for the 2020–21 academic year. Contact a campus to check availability and enroll your child.</p>

We will spray and wipe surfaces and fog the campus with electrostatic sprayers charged with chemicals that are effective against COVID-19. This practice has been proven to disinfect and slow the progression of the virus. We are prepared to complete this task on a daily basis.
